# Solvers

"Solvers" are models for question answering.  In this module, we define many such models,
separated into two main groups: those that take some notion of background knowledge as an explicit
input to the model, and those that don't.  We also define a number of concrete `Pretrainers` in
this module, which can be used to pre-train some subset of these solvers.
